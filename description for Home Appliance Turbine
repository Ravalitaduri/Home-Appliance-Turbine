This project aims at producing an alternate source of power. The main parts of our project are blower, turbine wheel made from domestic products, DC motor, reachargeable battery, LED chip. The principle of our project is that when the high speed air from blower impinges on the blade of turbine wheel the turbine rotates with high velocity. A DC motor is fixed to the end of the turbine shaft. When the turbine wheel rotates, the shaft of the DC motor also rotates. The DC motor when placed in opposite direction becomes an DC dynamo. Thus, DC current is generated in the DC motor. This current is stored in a rechargeable battery by placing a diode on poles. Then rechargeable battery is connected to a LEDchip.
